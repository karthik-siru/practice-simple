Sum Digits Until One
We're provided a positive integer num. Can you write a method to repeatedly add all of its digits until the result has only one digit?

Here's an example: if the input was 49, we'd go through the following steps:

// start with 49
4 + 9 = 13

// move onto 13
1 + 3 = 4
We would then return 4.

Constraints

   * Input will be in the range between 0 and 1000000000
   * Expected time complexity : O(log n)
   * Expected space complexity : O(1)

A little girl  darla counts from 1 to 1000 using the fingers of her left hand as
follows. She starts by calling her thumb 1, the first finger 2, middle finger 3,
ring finger 4, and little finger 5. Then she reverses direction, calling the ring
finger 6, middle finger 7, the first finger 8, and her thumb 9, after which she
calls her first finger 10, and so on. If she continues to count in this manner,
on which finger will she stop?
