Sum Digits Until One
We're provided a positive integer num. Can you write a method to repeatedly add all of its digits until the result has only one digit?

Here's an example: if the input was 49, we'd go through the following steps:

// start with 49
4 + 9 = 13

// move onto 13
1 + 3 = 4
We would then return 4.

Constraints

   * Input will be in the range between 0 and 1000000000
   * Expected time complexity : O(log n)
   * Expected space complexity : O(1)
