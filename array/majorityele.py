#Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm :
'''
 ->  MAJORITY-ELEMENT : element which occurs.. more than n//2 times in the array.
 ->  MAINTAIN A ELEMENT m AND  ITERATOR i 
 ->  for i in the nums.length : 
        # if i == 0 : 
              m = nums[i]
              i = 1 
          elif nums[i] == m : 
              i += 1
          else : 
              i -=  1 

 -> FINALLY ,WE WILL BE HAVING  MAJORITY ELEMENT IN m .
